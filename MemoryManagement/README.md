# Memory Management
## Description
  &nbsp;&nbsp;   This project has three sub projects which are all done for understanding the concepts of memory management in operating system such as how the memory allocation is done for reference and value typea ,how the garbage collector works and how and where the dispose methods are used.
## Implementation
   There are three sub projects .They are<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  1.ValueAndReferenceTypes<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;  2.GarbageCollector<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;    3.DisposeMethods
### ValueAndReferenceTypes
 &nbsp;&nbsp;    This project is build to understand the memory allocation for value and reference types and how they can be modified as separate tasks.

### GarbageCollector
  &nbsp;&nbsp;   This project is build to understand working of the garbage collector on unreferenced objects and the impacts in the memory usage.
### DisposeMethods
  &nbsp;&nbsp;   This project is build to understand the usage of dispose methods and how they can be used to release the memory of the objects by creating a streamwriter object and writing some data to a file and then releasing the memory of the object using dispose method.
