# Identifying Issues
 
### Inefficient Memory Usage:
 
The use of MemoryStream is not needed. Writing to the file directly would be more efficient than using the memeoryStream
 
### Lack of Thread Safety:
 
Multiple threads writing to the same file can cause race conditions, leads to throw errors and terminate the application's execution.
 
### File Access:
 
When multiple users log errors, they all write to the same log.txt file, causing data loss and unaccessible if it is using by other.
 
 ### Lack of detailed contents
 
Logs should include a timestamp and the user ID to identify easier.
