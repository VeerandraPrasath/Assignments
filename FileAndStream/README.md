# Title : Files and stream

## Project Description
This project is to understand the working and usage of files and streams .To understand those concepts ,given with four tasks which cover the topics such as synchronous ,asynchronous ,filestreams and thread safe etc.Implemented all the tasks in separate folders and documented the reflections.

## Implementation

### Task1
In task1,Used both the filestream and buffer stream to read file data to understand difference between the both and process read and writing file in an optimized way using synchronous way.

### Task2
In task2,To understand the resource utilization and performance of writing to file ,used synchronous and asynchronous way of writing to files.
### Task3
In task3,Identified the issues in the given started code and provide the optimized solution to fix the issues.
### Task4
In task4,To understand the race condtions and thread safety ,provided set of subtasks and implemented each subtasks in separate class file and documented the things to change in the given starter file
## Unit testing
Perform unit testing to the Files and Stream project using NUnit to verify the correct working of each and every methods in the projects.
