1.Explain what the .NET platform is and its primary purpose.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The .NET platform is a free,open source platform developed by Microsoft that helps developers to build application including web,mobile,desktop,gaming and IOT applications.<br>
Primary purpose of .NET :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.It provides libraries with pre-defined classes and functions to build applications.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.It also provides framework asp .net to build web applications.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3.It allows developers to build applications in multiple languages like C#,VB.NET,F#.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4.It provides a runtime environment to run the applications.<br>

2.What are the key components of the .NET platform?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main components in .NET platform:<br>
&nbsp;1.CLR(Common Language Runtime)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLR is the runtime environment that runs the code and it provides various services such as Garbage collection,Just in time compilation and exception handling.<br>
&nbsp;2.FCL(Framework Class Library)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FCL contains predefined classes and functions that are used to build applications when it is required.It includes Collections,Linq etc<br>

3.Differentiate between the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the Common Type System (CTS) in .NET.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CLR(Common Language Runtime) provide the runtime environment to run the application and it provides memory management ,error handling and compilation services whereas CTS(Common Type System) is used to  specifies how types must be defined ,used and  managed in the environment.<br>

4.What is the role of the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) in .NET?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Global Assembly Cache(GAC) is a code cache present in the Common Language Runtime(CLR) that stores informations about the assemblies to be shared by multiple applications within the  computer.

5.Explain the difference between value types and reference types in C#. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Value types are stored in stack memory which the changes are not reflected when it is passed and  modified by any other methods and reference types are stored in heap memory which shares the address of it so that any changes that made anywhere will be reflected.<br>

6.Describe the concept of garbage collection on .NET and its advantages. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage collection is used to handle the allocation and de-allocation of memory automatically .It uses three generations to manage memory and it starts work at anytime which is not predictable .

Advantages:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.It removes the unused memory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Improves the performance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3.It runs automatically rather than invoking manually.<br>

7.What is the purpose of the Globalization and Localization features in .NET? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of globalization is to develop the application which is common to every user from any region or culture  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of localization is to develop the application which is specific to the user from a particular region or culture.<br>

8.Explain the role of the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in the .NET framework. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Common Intermediate Language(CIL) is also known as MSIL(Microsoft Intermediate Language) which converts the actual code into an intermediate code using the C# compiler.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just-In-Time(JIT) compilation is used to convert the intermediate code into machine code which is platform independent.<br>
